This repo will contain a handbook explaining how the organizers plan meetups: what the roles are, what has to happen when, etc. 

A very short guide is needed because: 
* This will represent a clearer picture of all the work that goes into a meetup
* A clear outline will streamline the process of planning
* It will be easier for new organizers to join and help

Proposed table of contents: 
* Cast of Characters (what are the necessary roles in organizing a meetup; what does each person do; what tasks can be shared)
* The road map for planning meetups -- what are the milestones and when do they happen
* Tips and best practices (maximizing membership, engagement, benefits)
   - Brainstorming the programs that will draw a crowd
   - Increasing attendance and membership
