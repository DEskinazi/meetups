# Roles for organizers

## Introduction
If you've though about volunteering or your local Write The Docs meetup, but don't know where to begin, this page is for you. 

It's usually a bit scary to volunteer for an organization like Write The Docs, because people don't know how it works, and they wonder whether they are signing up for more than they can handle. To make it easier, we've created a list of roles that need to be filled, and elsewhere we've documented the process of volunteering and carrying out each role. 

## Jobs you can sign up for

Here are the most common roles organizers fill.

Before the event: 

* Plan events. Find speakers or programs for future meetings.
* Find sponsors, usually for venues and food
* Promote the event. Write copy for Meetup.com, and posts for social media. Find images for all the above, if possible. 

At the event: 

* Greet people. Make sure that everyone is welcomed and participates in the meeting. Provide some orientation for brand new attendes.
* Be the spokesperson at the event. Speak at the beginning and end. Acknowledge guests and volunteers. Invite members to become organizers. Promote future events. 
* Record meetings. 
* Take photographs or notes. Post to Slack or other social media after the meeting, so people will take note of the event. Get other people to post or to share your posts on social media. 

Unrelated to events: 

*Administer a GitHub repo. There are currently repos for:
   * storing meetup materials
   * the lone writers guide
   * this handbook
