# Tasks for Promoting Upcoming WTD Meetups

* Create a placeholder event on meetup.com at least a month before the event
* Post the event description before announcing the event (use the checklist for event announcement content)
* Add the event on Liz Fraleyâ€™s Bay Area tech writing events calendar
* Push the button to announce the event (preferably when the post is complete, but at least two weeks before the event)
* Promote the meetup.com event listing in these channels:
   + Slack (the WTD channels)
   + LinkedIn
   + Twitter
 * Share a link with all Bay Area organizers and ask them to promote it
 * Remind the speaker to share the event on social media, and to ask their contacts to promote it
